  abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

  abstract = {A new variant ?PMF? of factor analysis is described. It is assumed that X is a matrix of observed data and ? is the known matrix of standard deviations of elements of X. Both X and ? are of dimensions n × m. The method solves the bilinear matrix problem X = GF + E where G is the unknown left hand factor matrix (scores) of dimensions n × p, F is the unknown right hand factor matrix (loadings) of dimensions p × m, and E is the matrix of residuals. The problem is solved in the weighted least squares sense: G and F are determined so that the Frobenius norm of E divided (element-by-element) by ? is minimized. Furthermore, the solution is constrained so that all the elements of G and F are required to be non-negative. It is shown that the solutions by PMF are usually different from any solutions produced by the customary factor analysis (FA, i.e. principal component analysis (PCA) followed by rotations). Usually PMF produces a better fit to the data than FA. Also, the result of PF is guaranteed to be non-negative, while the result of FA often cannot be rotated so that all negative entries would be eliminated. Different possible application areas of the new method are briefly discussed. In environmental data, the error estimates of data can be widely varying and non-negativity is often an essential feature of the underlying models. Thus it is concluded that PMF is better suited than FA or PCA in many environmental applications. Examples of successful applications of PMF are shown in companion papers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF), a machine learning algorithm, has been applied to the analysis of microarray data. A key feature of NMF is the ability to identify patterns that together explain the data as a linear combination of expression signatures. Microarray data generally includes individual estimates of uncertainty for each gene in each condition, however NMF does not exploit this information. Previous work has shown that such uncertainties can be extremely valuable for pattern recognition. RESULTS: We have created a new algorithm, least squares non-negative matrix factorization, LS-NMF, which integrates uncertainty measurements of gene expression data into NMF updating rules. While the LS-NMF algorithm maintains the advantages of original NMF algorithm, such as easy implementation and a guaranteed locally optimal solution, the performance in terms of linking functionally related genes has been improved. LS-NMF exceeds NMF significantly in terms of identifying functionally related genes as determined from annotations in the MIPS database. CONCLUSION: Uncertainty measurements on gene expression data provide valuable information for data analysis, and use of this information in the LS-NMF algorithm significantly improves the power of the NMF technique.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The extended use of microarray technologies has enabled the generation and accumulation of gene expression datasets that contain expression levels of thousands of genes across tens or hundreds of different experimental conditions. One of the major challenges in the analysis of such datasets is to discover local structures composed by sets of genes that show coherent expression patterns across subsets of experimental conditions. These patterns may provide clues about the main biological processes associated to different physiological states. RESULTS: In this work we present a methodology able to cluster genes and conditions highly related in sub-portions of the data. Our approach is based on a new data mining technique, Non-smooth Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (nsNMF), able to identify localized patterns in large datasets. We assessed the potential of this methodology analyzing several synthetic datasets as well as two large and heterogeneous sets of gene expression profiles. In all cases the method was able to identify localized features related to sets of genes that show consistent expression patterns across subsets of experimental conditions. The uncovered structures showed a clear biological meaning in terms of relationships among functional annotations of genes and the phenotypes or physiological states of the associated conditions. CONCLUSION: The proposed approach can be a useful tool to analyze large and heterogeneous gene expression datasets. The method is able to identify complex relationships among genes and conditions that are difficult to identify by standard clustering algorithms.},

Coupled with a model selection mechanism, adapted to work for any stochastic clustering algorithm, NMF is an efficient method for identification of distinct molecular patterns and provides a powerful method for class discovery. We demonstrate the ability of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern discovery.},

We describe an approach to regulatory motif analysis based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Whereas existing pattern recognition algorithms commonly focus primarily on sequence content, our method simultaneously characterizes both positioning and sequence content of putative motifs. RESULTS: Tests on artificially generated sequences show that NMF can faithfully reproduce both positioning and content of test motifs. We show how the variation of the residual sum of squares can be used to give a robust estimate of the number of motifs or patterns in a sequence set. Our analysis distinguishes multiple motifs with significant overlap in sequence content and/or positioning. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the NMF approach through characterization of biologically interesting datasets. Specifically, an analysis of mRNA 3'-processing (cleavage and polyadenylation) sites from a broad range of higher eukaryotes reveals a conserved core pattern of three elements.},

@Article{Badea2008,
  abstract = {In this paper we introduce a clustering algorithm capable of simultaneously factorizing two distinct gene expression datasets with the aim of uncovering gene regulatory programs that are common to the two phenotypes. The siNMF algorithm simultaneously searches for two factorizations that share the same gene expression profiles. The two key ingredients of this algorithm are the nonnegativity constraint and the offset variables, which together ensure the sparseness of the factorizations. While cancer is a very heterogeneous disease, there is overwhelming recent evidence that the differences between cancer subtypes implicate entire pathways and biological processes involving large numbers of genes, rather than changes in single genes. We have applied our simultaneous factorization algorithm looking for gene expression profiles that are common between the more homogeneous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and the more heterogeneous colon adenocarcinoma. The fact that the PDAC signature is active in a large fraction of colon adeocarcinoma suggests that the oncogenic mechanisms involved may be similar to those in PDAC, at least in this subset of colon samples. There are many approaches to uncovering common mechanisms involved in different phenotypes, but most are based on comparing gene lists. The approach presented in this paper additionally takes gene expression data into account and can thus be more sensitive.},
